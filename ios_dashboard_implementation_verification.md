  - Proper accessibility identifiers for UI testing

### ✅ Add data period selection with iOS segmented controls
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Implementation**:
  - Native iOS `SegmentedPickerStyle` for period selection
  - Support for Daily, Weekly, Bi-weekly, and Monthly periods
  - Automatic data refresh when period changes
  - Proper state management with `@State` and `onChange` modifiers
  - Integration with shared ViewModel for period changes

### ✅ Create mock data visualization with iOS chart libraries
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Implementation**:
  - Integration with shared `MockAnalyticsRepository` for consistent data
  - Created `DashboardViewModel` wrapper for iOS-specific state management
  - Swift wrapper types (`AnalyticsDataSwift`, `DailyMetricSwift`, etc.) for seamless KMP integration
  - Mock data includes activity levels, communication counts, and analytics notes
  - Different chart types based on selected period (daily bars, weekly lines, etc.)

### ✅ Write iOS UI tests for dashboard interactions
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Implementation**:
  - Created comprehensive `DashboardScreenUITests.swift`
  - Tests cover:
    - Dashboard navigation and screen appearance
    - Caree selection interactions (single and multiple)
    - Period selection functionality
    - Analytics cards display verification
    - Loading states and error handling
    - Pull-to-refresh functionality
    - Accessibility compliance
    - Performance testing for loading and period switching
  - Helper methods for common test operations
  - Proper wait conditions and timeout handling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Integration
- **Shared ViewModel Integration**: Created `DashboardViewModel` as iOS wrapper around shared `AnalyticsViewModel`
- **Dependency Injection**: Extended `KoinHelper` to provide `AnalyticsUseCase`
- **State Management**: Proper `@StateObject` and `@Published` usage for reactive UI updates
- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional data flow from shared business logic to iOS UI

### iOS-Native Components Used
- **SwiftUI Charts**: Native iOS 16+ Charts framework for modern chart visualization
- **SegmentedPickerStyle**: Native iOS segmented control for period selection
- **ScrollView**: Horizontal scrolling for caree selection chips
- **NavigationView**: Standard iOS navigation with large title display mode
- **TabView Integration**: Proper integration with `CarerTabView` for navigation

### Error Handling & Loading States
- **Error Banner**: Custom `ErrorBanner` component for user-friendly error display
- **Loading Views**: Dedicated `LoadingView` component with progress indicators
- **Empty States**: `EmptySelectionView` for when no carees are selected
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback charts for older iOS versions

### Accessibility Features
- **VoiceOver Support**: Proper accessibility labels and identifiers
- **Large Text Support**: Dynamic type scaling compatibility
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44pt touch targets for elderly users
- **High Contrast**: Color scheme supports accessibility requirements

### Data Visualization Features
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Bar charts for activity, line charts for communication
- **Period-Based Views**: Different visualizations for daily, weekly, bi-weekly data
- **Interactive Elements**: Tap-to-select caree chips with visual feedback
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh when selections change
- **Notes Display**: Categorized analytics notes with timestamps

## Requirements Compliance

### ✅ Requirement 6.1: Display mock analytics data for carees
- Dashboard displays comprehensive analytics from `MockAnalyticsRepository`
- Data includes activity levels, communication frequency, and notes
- Proper handling of single and multiple caree selection

### ✅ Requirement 6.2: Filter dashboard data by caree selection
- Multi-select caree functionality implemented
- Real-time filtering based on selected carees
- Visual feedback for selection state

### ✅ Requirement 6.3: Present daily, weekly, and bi-weekly data with charts
- Segmented control for period selection
- Different chart visualizations for each period
- Automatic data refresh when period changes

### ✅ Requirement 6.4: Use visual charts and graphs for easy comprehension
- Native iOS Charts framework for modern visualizations
- Color-coded charts with deep purple theme
- Clear legends and axis labels
- Fallback charts for older iOS versions

### ✅ Requirement 6.5: Display mock data as placeholder content
- Integration with shared mock data repository
- Consistent mock data across platforms
- Graceful handling when real data is unavailable

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (Shared Layer)
- `AnalyticsViewModelTest.kt` - Business logic testing
- `MockAnalyticsRepository` - Data layer testing

### UI Tests (iOS Layer)
- `DashboardScreenUITests.swift` - Comprehensive UI interaction testing
- Navigation, selection, loading states, error handling
- Accessibility and performance testing

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end data flow from repository to UI
- Cross-platform consistency verification

## Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Charts only render when data is available
- **Efficient Updates**: Minimal re-renders on state changes
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of view models and observers
- **Smooth Animations**: Native iOS transitions and feedback

## Future Enhancements
- Real data integration when backend is available
- Additional chart types (pie charts, trend lines)
- Export functionality for analytics data
- Offline data caching and synchronization

## Verification Commands

To verify the implementation:

```bash
# Build iOS project
cd iosApp
xcodebuild -project iosApp.xcodeproj -scheme iosApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build

# Run UI tests
xcodebuild test -project iosApp.xcodeproj -scheme iosApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:iosAppUITests/DashboardScreenUITests
```

## Conclusion

The iOS dashboard implementation is complete and fully functional. It provides:
- Native iOS user experience with SwiftUI and Charts framework
- Seamless integration with shared Kotlin Multiplatform business logic
- Comprehensive testing coverage for reliability
- Accessibility compliance for elderly users
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Mock data visualization ready for real data integration

The implementation meets all specified requirements and follows iOS development best practices while maintaining consistency with the overall app architecture.
