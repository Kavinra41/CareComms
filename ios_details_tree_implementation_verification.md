## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Proper separation with ViewModel managing state
- **Shared Business Logic**: Integration with Kotlin Multiplatform shared module
- **iOS-Native UI**: SwiftUI implementation with native components
- **State Management**: Reactive state updates with `@StateObject` and `@Published`

### Key Components
1. **DetailsTreeScreen**: Main screen with navigation and layout
2. **DetailsTreeViewModel**: State management and business logic integration
3. **CareeSelectionTileView**: Grid-based caree selection interface
4. **CareeTileView**: Individual caree tile with selection states
5. **TreeContentView**: Scrollable tree content container
6. **TreeNodeView**: Recursive tree node component with animations

### iOS-Native Features
- **LazyVGrid**: Efficient collection view implementation
- **Spring Animations**: Natural iOS animation feel
- **NavigationView**: Proper iOS navigation structure
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and large touch targets
- **Dynamic Type**: Support for iOS text scaling
- **Native Styling**: iOS color schemes and typography

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient rendering of large tree structures
- **State Optimization**: Minimal re-renders with proper state management
- **Animation Performance**: Hardware-accelerated spring animations
