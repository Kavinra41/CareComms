# Android Details Tree Screen Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented Task 17: Create Android details tree screen with tile-style layout for caree selection and accordion-style expansion for data categories.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Tile-Style Layout for Caree Selection ✅
- **Grid Layout**: Implemented `LazyVerticalGrid` with 2 columns for caree tiles
- **Caree Tiles**: Created `CareeTile` composable with:
  - Gradient background using MaterialTheme colors
  - Person icon and health conditions count badge
  - Caree name, age, health conditions, and last activity
  - Animated press effect with spring animation
  - Aspect ratio of 1:1 for consistent tile sizing

### 2. Accordion-Style Expansion ✅
- **Smooth Animations**: Implemented `AnimatedVisibility` with:
  - `expandVertically()` and `fadeIn()` for expansion
  - `shrinkVertically()` and `fadeOut()` for collapse
  - Custom timing with `FastOutSlowInEasing` for professional feel
- **Rotation Animation**: Added rotating expand/collapse icon with `animateFloatAsState`
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Support for 4 levels (CAREE → CATEGORY → DETAIL → ITEM)

### 3. Hierarchical Navigation ✅
- **Two-Phase Navigation**:
  - Phase 1: Tile selection grid for caree selection
  - Phase 2: Accordion tree view for selected caree details
- **Back Navigation**: Implemented back button with icon and text
- **State Management**: Proper state reset when navigating between carees
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of current view and navigation options

### 4. Mock Data Display ✅
- **Comprehensive Mock Data**: Created detailed mock data structure including:
  - Health Information (Medications, Vital Signs)
  - Daily Activities (Exercise Routine, Meal Schedule)
  - Communication History (Recent Messages)
  - Care Notes (Care Observations)
- **Rich Data Details**: Each item includes relevant contextual information
- **Multiple Carees**: 4 different caree profiles with varied data

### 5. Enhanced UI Tests ✅
- **Tile Selection Tests**: Verify grid layout and caree tile functionality
- **Navigation Tests**: Test navigation between tile selection and details view
- **Accordion Tests**: Comprehensive testing of expand/collapse functionality
- **Hierarchical Tests**: Test multi-level expansion and state management
- **Data Display Tests**: Verify correct display of mock data at all levels
- **State Management Tests**: Test state preservation and reset behavior

## Key Features Implemented

### Visual Design
- **Material Design**: Consistent with app theme using deep purple color scheme
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid adapts to screen size with proper spacing
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between different node types
- **Accessibility**: Large touch targets and clear visual feedback

### Animations
- **Tile Press Animation**: Spring-based scale animation for tile selection
- **Accordion Animation**: Smooth expand/collapse with rotation indicators
- **Fade Transitions**: Smooth content appearance/disappearance
- **Timing**: Professional animation timing (300ms expansion, 200ms collapse)

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear visual cues for navigation and interaction
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed progressively through accordion
- **Consistent Interaction**: Uniform behavior across all expandable elements
- **Error Prevention**: Disabled interactions where appropriate

## Technical Implementation

### Components Structure
```
DetailsTreeScreen (Main Container)
├── CareeSelectionGrid (Tile Layout)
│   └── CareeTile (Individual Tiles)
└── DetailsTreeView (Accordion Layout)
    └── TreeNodeItem (Recursive Accordion Items)
```

### State Management
- **Local State**: Using `remember` and `mutableStateOf` for UI state
- **Expansion State**: Set-based tracking of expanded nodes
- **Navigation State**: Simple string-based caree selection
- **Animation State**: Automatic state management through Compose animations

### Data Models
- **TreeNode**: Hierarchical data structure with type, icon, and children
- **CareeInfo**: Caree profile information for tile display
- **NodeType**: Enum for different hierarchy levels (CAREE, CATEGORY, DETAIL, ITEM)

## Requirements Compliance

✅ **Requirement 7.1**: Tile-style boxes for caree selection implemented
✅ **Requirement 7.2**: Accordion expansion for data categories implemented  
✅ **Requirement 7.3**: Hierarchical navigation with smooth animations implemented
✅ **Requirement 7.4**: Comprehensive information display implemented
✅ **Requirement 7.5**: Smooth accordion-style animations implemented
✅ **Requirement 7.6**: Mock data placeholder content implemented

## Testing Coverage

### UI Tests Implemented
- Tile layout and caree selection functionality
- Navigation between selection and details views
- Accordion expansion and collapse behavior
- Multi-level hierarchy navigation
- Data display verification at all levels
